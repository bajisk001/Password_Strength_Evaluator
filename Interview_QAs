- Something you **are** (biometric like fingerprint)

## 6. How do password managers help?
Password managers **generate, store, and autofill complex passwords securely**. They reduce the risk of reuse and allow users to maintain **unique, strong passwords** for each account without memorizing them.

---

## 7. What are passphrases?
Passphrases are **long sequences of words or characters** that are easier to remember but highly secure.  
**Example:** `"Sunshine!Rocks_2025#Cloud"`  
They combine length, complexity, and memorability.

## 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
- Using **short or simple passwords** (`123456`, `password`)
